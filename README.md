# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

### Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a Python-based multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game using a client-server architecture. This project will demonstrate fundamental concepts of socket programming and networking by allowing multiple players to connect and play the game in real time.

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using Python and sockets.

**How to play:**
1. **Start the server:** Run the `server.py` script.
2. **Connect clients:** Run the `client.py` script on two different machines or terminals.
3. **Play the game:** Players take turns entering their moves. The first player to get three in a row wins!

**Technologies used:**
* Python
* Sockets

**Additional resources:**
* [Link to Python documentation]
* [Link to sockets tutorial]
